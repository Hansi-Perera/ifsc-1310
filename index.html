                 Web accessibility is the process of making your website accessible to as many people as possible. Including people with impaired vision or hearing, cognitive or physical disabilities, and or the elderly. 
            Web accessibility also includes people with slower wifi, different devices or browsers. There are many pros to making your website accessible. Most importantly, more people will access your website; with a greater reach,
            whatever information you are attempting to present with the site you've created will reach a larger audience. I think that is the most important from the developers point of view, more people will see your thoughts and ideas. 
            Second thing that comes to mind is the laws, you do not want to get flagged or face lawsuits that are not accessible to all people. It makes sense logically though, by not making your website easy to access, you may face allegations 
            of discrimination even though that is not how you intended it to be. Lastly, it just seems more sustainable to have an accessible website. If your website is going to be around for a 
            longer period of time, you want to make the necessary changes so that many groups and types of people will be able to access and continue to access the site you have created into the future.
