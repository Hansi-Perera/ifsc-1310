    <h1>Web Accessibility Assignment</h1>
    <p>
        Web accessibility is the process of making your website accessible to as many people as possible, including people with impaired vision or hearing, cognitive or physical disabilities, and the elderly. Web accessibility also includes people with slower wifi, different devices, or browsers. There are many pros to making your website accessible. Most importantly, more people will access your website; with a greater reach, whatever information you are attempting to present with the site you've created will reach a larger audience. I think that is the most important from the developer's point of view, more people will see your thoughts and ideas. The second thing that comes to mind is the laws; you do not want to get flagged or face lawsuits that are not accessible to all people. It makes sense logically though, by not making your website easy to access, you may face allegations of discrimination even though that is not how you intended it to be. Lastly, it just seems more sustainable to have an accessible website. If your website is going to be around for a longer period of time, you want to make the necessary changes so that many groups and types of people will be able to access and continue to access the site you have created into the future.

    <h1>Progressive Enhancement Assignment</h1>
    
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a web development approach that starts with a solid foundation for web content and functionality, ensuring a basic experience for all users. Unlike the older approach of Graceful Degradation, which focuses on designing for the latest browsers, Progressive Enhancement prioritizes the core content and adds sophistication based on the user's browser or device capabilities.

        In this mindset, content is crucial, aiming to create a universally accessible web in line with Tim Berners-Lee's vision. The process begins by structuring content in rich, semantic HTML as the base layer. This content is then enhanced with a layer of CSS for presentation and JavaScript for interactivity.

        Progressive Enhancement is essential in modern web development for various reasons. It ensures inclusive accessibility, making content available to users with different technology levels, including those on older browsers, mobile devices, or with disabilities. By starting with a basic experience and progressively enhancing it, developers can cater to a broader audience while providing advanced features to users with modern browsers.

        Moreover, Progressive Enhancement offers future-proofing, allowing websites to adapt to new technologies and devices without compromising core content and functionality. It contributes to SEO friendliness, as well-structured semantic HTML makes content easily indexable by search engines. Additionally, separating content, style, and functionality makes the codebase more maintainable and adaptable to changing requirements.

        In summary, Progressive Enhancement aligns with the original ideals of the web by prioritizing content and accessibility. It provides a flexible and future-proof approach to web development, ensuring a positive user experience for a diverse audience.

    <h1>My IFSC-1310 Web Development Journey</h1>

  <p>Embarking on the IFSC-1310 web development journey had its highs and lows. Starting with the Gordo HTML assignment was quite fun and satisfyingâ€”I jumped into image manipulation using Gravit and tackled challenges like Flexbox Froggy which I also found challenging but intriguing and stimulating.</p>

  <p>Looking back, there's room for improvement. The SpaceX project taught me the importance of starting early and seeking feedback, especially on tricky href links. Through the entire homepage project my links especially to the images are somewhat janky and work sometimes and not others. </p>

  <p>Dealing with links and CSS was challenging. If I could redo it, I'd focus on consistency, especially with CSS and Java content links. I'd pay extra attention to homepage links and make up for a missed assignment like the cycle lab. Recognizing the importance of small details would make my homepage stronger. If I had refined my work more, I would have gotten a little more out of this class and I plan to take that information moving forwards
    and remember to try my best always and put my most effort throughout. I attempted to mess with colors and fonts but a lot of my links would not ultimately connect or go through. I would also like to ask that you take a look at my code spaces and efforts, because the website really isnt doing my justice. 
  </p>

  <p>Time was a significant challenge. Reflecting on my passion for programming and C++, I realize investing more time in this course would've been wise. Being more meticulous with assignments would've led to a better outcome.</p>

  <p>This journey refined my tech skills and deepened my interest in web development. Each project was a step, making me more sophisticated.</p>

  <p>Now, as I near the end, these lessons guide my future projects. Looking back this class has sparked my intrest in the evolving world of web development.</p>
